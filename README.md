# KeyKlot: Sliding Block Puzzle Game

KeyKlot is a browser-based puzzle game built with React and Vite. The objective is to move the main block (Cao Cao) to the exit at the bottom of the board, inspired by classic sliding block puzzles. All logic is client-side and implemented in TypeScript/React for rapid iteration and clarity.
